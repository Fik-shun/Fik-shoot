The corona and redeclipse skyboxes were made with Spacescape version 0.3,

The image of the red eclipse in the redeclipse skybox is originally based on a
photo by Luc Viatour <http://www.Lucnix.be> taken from
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_eclips_1999_4.jpg> which is
licensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0.
It has been modified by Dratz-C prior to inclusion in the skybox.
